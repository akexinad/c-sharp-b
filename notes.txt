CLR FUNDAMENTALS
================

- CLR = Common Language Runtime.
- It is a application that sits in memory and translates IL code, Intermediate Language, into Native Code that the machine's hardware can understand.
- The reason for this Intermediate Langauge is so C# can be understood by any machine regardless of the computer architecture.
- The process of compiling IL code into Native is called JIT, Just-in-Time Compilation.
- Therefore, with CLR, you can run C# on any machine, regardless of its architecture.




ARCHITECTURE OF .NET APPLICATIONS
=================================

- When building an application with C#, at a high level its a bunch of classes that collaborate with each other at runtime.

- WHAT IS A CLASS?
    - A class is a container that holds DATA, aka ATTRIBUTES, and functions, aka, METHODS.
    - METHODS HAVE BEHAVIOUR, they execute code. They do things for us.
    - DATA REPRESENTS THE STATE OF THE APPLICATION.

- So in a real world app we 1000's of these classes interacting.
- To organise all these classes we use...

NAMESPACES
    - A conatiner for related classes.
    - There can be namespaces for working with databases, graphics, images, security.

- And as the quantity of namespaces grow, we then use...

ASSEMBLIES
    - An assembly is a container for related namespaces.
    - It is physically a file on the disk as an exe. - Executable - or a dll - Dynamically Linked Library.

- So when you compile an app, it is compile a bunch of these assemblies.




THE USING STATMENTS
===================

- System: A namespace in .NET with all the utility classes and primitive types.
- System.Collections.Generic: Used to work with lists and collections.
- System.Linq: Used to work with data.
- System.Text: Used to work with text and coding.
- System.Threading.Tasks: Used to create multithreaded apps.
